By sequencing the RNA within each cell, it reveals cellular heterogeneity, identifies different cell types and states, and discovers differentially expressed genes. This is crucial for understanding the functions of different cell subpopulations in complex biological systems (such as the tumor microenvironment, immune responses). Application: In this study, scRNA-seq was used to map gene activity in individual cells of injured auricles and to compare the gene activity of wound-induced fibroblasts (WIFs) in regenerative (rabbit) and non-regenerative (mouse) species.",

This allows researchers to identify cellular heterogeneity within tissues and determine the distribution of transcripts across different tissue regions.

At a specific phase, it moves upward away from the n-nullcline, causing the equilibrium point to disappear and initiating firing. When the excitatory stimulus is strong, such as at the peak of the positional field potential, the v-nullcline is positioned higher on the y-axis, resulting in an earlier theta phase for spike initiation. Conversely, when the excitatory stimulus is weak, the theta phase for spike initiation is later. Thus, disregarding other input influences, the spike potentials of a CA3 excitatory cell during the middle of positional firing occur at an earlier theta phase compared to those during the early or late stages.",

It is defined as a specific type of symmetric (secret-key) encryption scheme engineered to function as a bridge between different message spaces in a hybrid homomorphic system. Its primary purpose is to enable a public-key encryption scheme, which is homomorphic only over a small message space, to effectively operate over a much larger target message space. The core of the MeSA primitive is a carefully structured algebraic relationship between its keys and plaintexts. Rather than being 'homomorphic in its keys,' the MeSA is required to possess a keyed homomorphic property. Specifically, let MeSA.Enc(ek,m) be the encryption of a message m under a key ek, and let MeSA.Dec(ek,c) be the corresponding decryption. For the MeSA to be effective, it must support a public operation, denoted by ⊞, on its ciphertexts such that for any two key-message pairs (ek1,m1) and (ek2,m2): MeSA.Dec(ek1+ek2,MeSA.Enc(ek1,m1)⊞MeSA.Enc(ek2,m2))=m1+m2. This property ensures that a homomorphic addition performed on the keys (which are encrypted by the outer scheme) translates directly into a corresponding homomorphic addition of the underlying messages. This allows the construction to leverage the homomorphic properties of the outer scheme on a small key space to induce a homomorphic property on the inner scheme over a large message space, without altering the outer scheme's structure.",

Intermittent daily fasting is crucial for the key phenotypes induced by CR: only under conditions of prolonged fasting can CR significantly improve insulin sensitivity, alter fuel utilization patterns, increase fatty acid oxidation, and trigger molecular transcriptomic remodeling in the liver and adipose tissue associated with extended healthspan. Simply reducing calories without fasting cannot replicate these effects. Moreover, even without lowering total energy intake, imposing daily prolonged fasting alone can reproduce most of the metabolic and molecular features of CR, namely enhanced fatty acid levels and metabolism, along with suppressed glucose oxidation pathways.",
            "Fatty acid metabolism in hair follicles In recent years, research has increasingly recognized that hair follicles not only depend on protein structures and signaling pathways but are also closely tied to lipid metabolism for their normal function. Multiple studies in mice and humans have confirmed that abnormal lipid metabolism can cause severe hair follicle damage and hair loss, including cicatricial alopecia. Specifically, these phenotypes may be mediated through several mechanisms: (1) lipid imbalance induces excessive activation of inflammatory signaling, leading to hair follicle stem cell damage; (2) metabolic stress in organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria results in reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis; and (3) impaired lipid modifications disrupt key developmental signals such as Hedgehog and Wnt. In summary, abnormal lipid metabolism is a critical factor in hair follicle pathology, suggesting that targeting lipid metabolic pathways (e.g., PPARγ regulation or cholesterol synthesis inhibition) may provide new therapeutic approaches for hair disorders.",
            "Hair follicle stem cell growth cycle and metabolism The hair follicle growth cycle can be divided into the anagen (growth), telogen (resting), and catagen (regression) phases. Under normal conditions, hair follicle metabolism primarily relies on glucose oxidation as the main energy source. During the anagen phase, hair follicles accumulate glycogen, which markedly decreases in the catagen phase. In ex vivo hair follicle culture experiments, using a glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL)–specific inhibitor blocked glycogen breakdown, thereby significantly promoting follicle elongation and hair shaft formation while delaying the onset of catagen. Notably, glucose metabolism in hair follicle stem cells did not increase under these conditions. These findings indicate that glycogen functions not only as an energy reserve but also as a key regulator of hair follicle growth and cycling. The study ultimately proposed that regulation of PYGL activity may represent a novel therapeutic target for hair growth disorders and alopecia-related diseases, and provides new directions for the application of hair follicle metabolism in regenerative dermatology."

If fewer than 6 peaks were identified, the circle was fitted around the outermost peak. The central peak was not included in the analysis. For grid cells, the correlation varied sinusoidally as a function of the amount of rotation.

            "Type 17 Inflammation Mediates Gut Microbiota-Associated Inflammation. Type 17 inflammation is a type of immune response centered on the IL-17 cytokine pathway, mainly mediated by CD4+ Th17 cells, while γδ T cells, ILC3s, NKT cells, and other cell types can also secrete IL-17 to participate in this process. The differentiation of Th17 cells depends on the transcription factor RORγt (product of the Rorc gene) and is driven by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TGF-β for differentiation; their maintenance and expansion require IL-23/IL-23R signaling. The effector molecules IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 can promote epithelial cells to express antimicrobial peptides (e.g., Defb4, Reg3γ) and chemokines (e.g., CXCL1, CXCL8), thereby strongly recruiting and activating neutrophils and enhancing mucosal barrier function. In bacterial infections, Type 17 inflammation is crucial for defending against extracellular bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and protects the host by promoting bacterial clearance and barrier repair. However, sustained overactivation of the IL-17 pathway can lead to tissue damage and chronic inflammation, contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and chronic pulmonary infections. Therefore, Type 17 inflammation exhibits a double-edged sword effect in bacterial infections: it is not only a key mechanism for mucosal defense but also an important driver of chronic inflammation and immune-related diseases. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-024-01218-x",

In contrast, in neuroinflammatory conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis), more types of immune cells can breach the BBB and further cross the glia limitans to enter the CNS parenchyma, thereby driving inflammatory responses. https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.805657",

However, molecular mimicry is unlikely to be the only potential mechanism for autoimmune responses; other factors, such as disruption of central tolerance, non-specific bystander activation, or sustained antigen stimulation, may also contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases.
